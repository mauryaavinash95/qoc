SYSTEM_EVAL_COUNT = CONTROL_EVAL_COUNT
# Note that `CONTROL_COUNT` is the length of the `controls` array that is passed
# to our `hamiltonian` function.
# `CONTROL_EVAL_COUNT` is used to determine how many points in time the `controls` are
# evaluated. It is likely this value should be consistent with a physical apparatus,
# such as the sampling rate of an AWG. The points in time where controls are evaluated
# is given by control_eval_times = np.linspace(0, evolution_time, control_eval_count).
# Note that qoc uses an interpolation method to interpolate the control parameters
# between these time points. You can change this behavior using the
# `interpolation_policy` argument.
# SYSTEM_EVAL_COUNT is used to determine the update step of the evolution.
# Similarly, system_eval_times = np.linspace(0, evolution_time, system_eval_count).
# Two important things happen at each system_eval step.
# First, cost functions that are computed multiple times throughout
# the evolution (as opposed to those only computed at the end of evolution)
# are evaluated at system_eval steps. You can change this behavior using the
# `cost_eval_step` argument. Second, qoc uses an exponential series method
# to integrate the schroedinger equation. `system_eval_times` specifies the
# time steps used in this integration. Therefore, increasing the `system_eval_count`
# will likely increase the accuracy of the evolution. The accuracy of the evolution
# can also be increased with the `magnus_policy` argument. Increasing the accuracy
# using both of these methods will increase the computational cost.
# Note that qoc does not use an exponential series method to integrate the lindblad
# equation. Therefore, increasing the `system_eval_count` for lindblad methods
# will not increase the accuracy of their evolution.

# Next, we define the system hamiltonian.
# Control parameters are values that you will use to vary time-dependent control fields
# that act on your system. Note that qoc supports both complex and real control parameters.
